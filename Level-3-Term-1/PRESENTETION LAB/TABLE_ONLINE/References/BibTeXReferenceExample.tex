Cognitive radio networks consists of primary users and secondary users, where primary users are licensed to use the wireless frequency bands, however, secondary users opportunistically  access the spectrum when corresponding primary user remains inactive~\cite{akyildiz2008survey}. Since primary users are the original owner of the spectrum, whenever, a primary user becomes active, secondary user communicating on the respective spectrum band, needs to stop its activity and find another spectrum channel to transmit. Consequently, secondary users experience switching delay in cognitive radio networks~\cite{wang10infocom}. Our study presents a theoretical model of this switching delay and tries to reduce the delay accordingly.
