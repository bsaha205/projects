  This report tells all the process for writing a nice and worthy thesis paper,research paper or report.For publishing research papers in a well-known scientific magazines,that research papers must be well written.And this report says exactly that by using latex environment.One must follow the rules that have discussed here for writing a good research paper.

  \chapter{Research in Computer Science and Engineering}
  \paragraph{In Computer Science and Engineering research is the starting step of inventing new revolution.No big job comes without research.But at the time of research one should follow some rules.Otherwise research may be lengthy or may not bring any good result. \\Steps to follow:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Study and explore your area of interest.
computer science and engineering;
  \item Choose a research problem.
  \item Find one or two co-researchers and form a research group.
 \item Read related research papers published in good journals
and conferences and present those papers in the group, by
rotation.
 \item Sit frequently for brainstorming on the problem and try to
find non-trivial results.
\item Find good results around the problem and write papers.
  \end{itemize}

complete.}
\begin{description}
  \item[**   ] make general statements about the problem related
subject and define the problem.
\item[**   ] bring out the importance of the problem from theoretical
and application point of view.
\item[**  ] present an overview on the history and current research on
the problem. Justify a research gap for your study.
\item[**  ] continue a tradition, or propose a completely new
approach.
\item[**  ] sketch the intent of your own work and outline important
characteristics and results of your own work.
\item[**  ] give an outline of the organization of the paper.
\end{description}

\section{Organization of your paper}

\item Always try to do quality research.
\item One good publication is better than dozens of poor
publications.
